Train two models based on different datasets, one uses all datasets and another one only use the traces collected from actual running apps.

## Dynamic malware detection and phylogeny analysis using process mining

Small sequnce of syscalls with args collected from 1200 trusted and malicious applications across ten malware families on mobile phone.

We may need a filter for this dataset to adjust the massive number of `clock_gettime`. I'm concern about it will impact the model to predict clock_gettime frequently. 

```

## On Improving Deep Learning Trace Analysis with System Call Arguments

> Dataset 2 (industry)

> can be used for us? - YES✅

This dataset is generated by an Apache server-client app and collected by LTTng in CTF (Common Trace Format). CTF includes a metadata section that describes the binary data in the trace files and uses a subset of the TSDL (Trace Stream Description Language).

```
# metadata snippet
event {
	name = "syscall_entry_write";
	id = 5;
	stream_id = 0;
	fields := struct {
		integer { size = 32; align = 8; signed = 0; encoding= none; base = 10; } _fd;
		integer { size = 64; align = 8; signed = 0; encoding = none; base = 10; } _buf;
		integer { size = 64; align = 8; signed = 0; encoding = none; base = 10; } _count;
	};
};

event {
	name = "syscall_exit_writev";
	id = 312;
	stream_id = 0;
	fields := struct {
		integer { size = 64; align = 8; signed = 1; encoding = none; base = 10; } _ret;
		integer { size = 64; align = 8; signed = 0; encoding = none; base = 10; } _vec;
	};
};
```

This dataset contains 66 million lines of traces in total (both entry and exit and other).

```

```

### Conversion

#### Phase 1 - merge syscall_entry\_* (parameters) and syscall_exit_\* (return value) into one trace

Goals:

Normalize syscall and args and return value and start time.

Rules: 

1. Extract 

   1. syscall name 
   2. and its parameters 
   3. and its return value 
   4. and entry time 
   5. and process name for resource locating;

2. We will encounter entry trace first to get the syscall name and its parameters and entry time;

3. We should find its corresponding return value (syscall_exit_) in the next 1S traces;

4. Target converted data should look like as follow.

   ```
   openat @Param@{ dfd = -100, filename = "/usr/lib/firefox/libXt.so.6", flags = 524288, mode = 0 }@Param@ @Ret@{ ret = 57 }@Ret@ @Time@04:48:53.574837309@time@ @Proc@firefox@Proc@
   
   read @Param@{ fd = 23, count = 1 }@Param@ @Ret@{ ret = 1, buf = 140723345741599 }@Ret@ @Time@04:48:53.579737309@Time@ @Proc@firefox@Proc@
   
   close @Param@{ fd = 12 }@Param@ @Ret{ ret = 0 }@Ret@ @Time@04:48:53.974837309@Time@ @Proc@firefox@Proc@
   
   sendmsg @Param@{ fd = 55, msg = 139820868476640, flags = 16384 }@Param@ @Ret@{ ret = 220 }@Ret@ @Time@04:49:00.574837309@Time@ @Proc@firefox@Proc@
   ```

**Issue**

The trace contains some long consecutive same calls.

```
Consecutive calls greater than 100:
madvise: 314 times
newstat: 173 times
futex: 2638 times
read: 11 times
poll: 4 times
mprotect: 17 times
rt: 1 times

Consecutive calls greater than 500:
madvise: 46 times
futex: 1116 times
newstat: 4 times
poll: 2 times
mprotect: 4 times
```

#### Phase 2 - syzkaller format

Goals:

Split traces into programs by time and set resources.

Rules:

1. Target data:

   ```
   [SEP]
   openat$SyzLLM(-100, "/usr/lib/firefox/libXt.so.6", 524288, 0)
   read$SyzLLM(openat$SyzLLM(-100, "/usr/lib/firefox/libXt.so.6", 524288, 0), 1)
   close$SyzLLM(openat$SyzLLM(-100, "/usr/lib/firefox/libXt.so.6", 524288, 0))
   sendmsg$SyzLLM(socket$SyzLLM(1, 524289, 0), 139820868476640, 16384)
   [SEP]
   ```

2. Within every second there are average `3.3e7/180s=183,333` calls. I think the program size is a key factor to the model's performance. And if we choose 100 as the size so we need to split programs every `1s/(183,333/100)=0.0005s=0.5ms`.

   - We should focus on the later stage of fuzzing where run larger programs than the initial stage like 10 to 20 calls per program. But I found the program sizes have not much change compare with the initial stage and rare programs have more than 20 calls.

3. We should search for resources by fd and return value and use resources to replace consumers's fd.

   - some fd may mismatch.

> Result: Google Drive (370k programs with avg size of 100 calls)

#### Phase 3 - training format

Goals:

Normalize args for training.

Rules:

1. There are only three formats of args in the training data - resource, addr, constant. 

   - The constants are meaningful (e.g. flag, mode) and we should retain and convert them to hex. 
   - Addresses are related to strings (e.g. path) and data structures (e.g. msg) and we can assign to them.
   - Fallback: Assign resources if not any match.

2. Target data:

   ```
   [SEP]
   openat$SyzLLM(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000008000)='./file0\x00', 0x80000, 0x0)
   read$SyzLLM(@RSTART@openat$SyzLLM(0x0, &(0x7f0000008000)='/proc/keys\x00', 0x1, 0x0)@REND@, &(0x7f0000017000)=""/64, 0x1)
   close$SyzLLM(@RSTART@openat$SyzLLM(0x0, &(0x7f0000008000)='/proc/keys\x00', 0x1, 0x0)@REND@)
   sendmsg$SyzLLM(@RSTART@socket$SyzLLM(0x1, 0x1, 0x1)@REND@, (0x7f000000f000)={&(0x7f000000f400)=nil, 0x1, &(0x7f000000f800)={&(0x7f000000fc00)=@newlink={0x1, 0x1, 0x401, 0x1, 0x1, {0x1, 0x1, 0x1}, [@IFLA_MASTER={0x8, 0x3}, @IFLA_LINKINFO={0x20, 0x12, 0x0, 0x1, @bond={{0x9}, {0x10, 0x2, 0x0, 0x1, [@IFLA_BOND_ARP_IP_TARGET={0x4}, @IFLA_BOND_ARP_INTERVAL={0x8, 0x7, 0x6}]}}}]}, 0x1}, 0x1, 0x1, 0x1, 0x0}, 0x4000)

## TwinDroid

> [Dataset](https://github.com/AsmaLif/TwinDroid-dataset)
>
> can be used for us? - YES✅

This dataset contains 400 system call traces on Android, which is collected from 151 applications (59 benign and 92 malicious). Each trace contains so many calls (2k+).

*Should we truncate these traces to more smaller ones to get more call traces? we can overlap some tokens at both ends to maintain context continuity.* Group traces within a reasonable interval like 500ms into programs.

This dataset contains syscalls with args in separated traces.

The repository aims for storage-related I/O trace and there is a warning these traces are too old.

The latest dataset (2014) only contains 4 syscalls (open close read write).
